# Clustering-and-Validation-Techniques


<p><b>The objective of this clustering project is to implement different clustering methods to synthetic and
real-world data and validate using external and internal validation techniques</b></p>


- I have used K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to generate clusters to evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm using external validation metrics

- Plotting (2D or 3D) data points for each dataset and coloring them according to the
<b>original class</b>

- Plotting (2D or 3D) data points for each dataset and coloring them according to the
<b>class allocated by the clustering algorithm</b>


#### For the World Indicators-:

The world indicators dataset compares different countries based on selected attributes.
- I have Used  K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to group similar countries
together

- Also used Internal validation metrics to report the cluster quality

- Reporting the best clustering solution, which will give a detailed list of all the groups and the
countries included within the groups

- Finally generating different scatter plots and coloring the data points
based on  “Life expectancy vs GDP”,  “Infant Mortality vs
GDP”, etc.
